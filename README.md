Cristiano Miranda's Bayvalley Tech Module 1 Login UI Project.

This branch of the my login ui project utilizes CSS styling to display a background image that is found on unsplash by Yuriy Kovalev.
It also makes use of a media query that will change the background of the webpage to a solid color depending on if the browser window's height or width becomes less than a certain pixel size.
Another small change I made was to change the background color of the input text boxes if they have the user's focus.
