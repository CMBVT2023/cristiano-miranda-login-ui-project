# cristiano-miranda-login-ui-project
Cristiano Miranda's Bayvalley Tech Module 1 Login UI Project.

This is my initial login-ui project, it closely replicates the login-ui example.
I created a branch of this basic login-ui named "background-change" that utilizes more CCS styling to make the login-ui more unique.
To access this branch enter the command "git checkout background-change" to view the additional changes I made to the project.
